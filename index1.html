    <p>
      We are a group of students hoping to let people feel more secure about the messages they send to other people by letting them encrypt their messages and also store them semi-securely. Hope you enjoy our website and protect your security.

    <h5>Encryption</h5>
      <p>
      We encrypt by int-casting the each individual letter and the encryption code.  We then use modulo arithmatic to encrypt the message.  To deincrypt we just reverse the modulo. Our storing service simply stores the message with the name of the password, and retrieves it when you enter the name
