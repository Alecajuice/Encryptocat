    <h5>Encryption</h5>
      <p>
      We encrypt by int-casting the each individual letter and the encryption code.  We then use modulo arithmatic to encrypt the message.  To deincrypt we just reverse the modulo.  We also provide a Phrase Generator so you can come up with <a href="http://xkcd.com/936/" class="lel">easy to remember</a> phrases for your keys!
